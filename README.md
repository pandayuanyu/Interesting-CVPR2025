# Interesting CVPR 2025 Papers
A collection fo interesting CVPR 2025 papers 


### [🌹Birth and Death of a Rose](https://chen-geng.com/rose4d)  
Automatically generates the temporal evolution of an object's shape, color, and texture from a pretrained 2D model, enabling high-quality, controllable 3D dynamics—such as the blooming of a rose.  

### [🏙️ WonderWorld: Interactive 3D Scene Generation from a Single Image](https://kovenyu.com/wonderworld/) 
Transforms a single image into an interactive 3D scene sequence, similar to Fei-Fei Li's work on spatial intelligence applications.  

### [📍GPS as a Control Signal for Image Generation](https://cfeng16.github.io/gps-gen/)  
Uses GPS coordinates and text prompts to generate realistic cityscape photos.  

### [🌍 Around the World in 80 Timesteps](https://nicolas-dufour.github.io/plonk)  
A diffusion model for **photo geolocation inference**, reminiscent of **GeoGuessr**!  

### [🦌 Reconstructing Animals and the Wild](https://raw.is.tue.mpg.de/)  
Reconstructs **3D models of animals and natural scenes** from a single image—potentially useful for wildlife documentaries or animated films.  

### [🔬 Seeing A 3D World in A Grain of Sand](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00260)  
Captures multi-view images of **miniature scenes** using a multi-mirror system for high-quality **3D reconstruction**.  

### [🖼️ Generative Photomontage](https://lseancs.github.io/generativephotomontage/)  
Standard text-to-image models are **stochastic**, making it hard to generate an image that perfectly matches a user’s intent. This method **assembles image parts** from multiple generations into a composite **generative montage**.  

### [📸 Generative Photography: Scene-Consistent Camera Control for Realistic Text-to-Image Synthesis](https://generative-photography.github.io/project/)
The first **generative model** capable of controlling **camera settings** while maintaining **scene consistency**. It enables **precise bokeh, focal length, shutter speed, and color temperature control**.
